Go Brainfuck
------------

# What this is

Yet another unoptimized Brainfuck compiler. This is my test platform for
messing around with compilers, optimizations, interpreters, etc. It works, but
it sure ain't pretty.

At this moment, it reads the Brainfuck from stdin, translates it into a valid C program, and emits that out stdout. Feed the result into a C compiler, and it should work just fine.
