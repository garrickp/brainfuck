-          Decrement the cell currently pointer at                  mem[p] -= 1;
>          Move pointer 1 cell rightwards                           p += 1;
<          Move pointer 1 cell leftwards                            p -= 1;
.          Output the cell currently pointed at                     System.out.write(mem[p]);
,          Read a byte of input into the cell currently pointed at  System.in.read(mem, p, 1);
[          If the current cell is non-zero then enter a loop        while (mem[p]!=0) {
]          If the current cell is non-zero then keep looping        }
